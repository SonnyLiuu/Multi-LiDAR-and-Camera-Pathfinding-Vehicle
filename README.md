A Wi-Fi-connected mobile robot that autonomously follows a colored target. A camera (ESP32-CAM) streams live MJPEG video to a host that runs a real-time vision pipeline (OpenCV + NumPy). The pipeline thresholds the image in HSV (with hue wrap), filters noise by keeping the largest connected component, computes the blob centroid, and issues movement commands (W/A/D/S) based on blob position. Commands are transported reliably to the robot: either directly over UDP to an ESP8266 or forwarded via an ESP32 bridge that converts UDP → ESPNOW, which the ESP8266 receives to drive an L298N motor controller (four motors) in a mechanum wheel configuration.
